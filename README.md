To run this code successfully, please follow the instructions below:

(1) You will have to run the code sequentially (in order of filename). If you run a later file without having previously run an earlier file, the script will probably throw an error.  
(2) Wherever you see the script change the directory to 'codedir', you will need to change this to the working directory in which you have downloaded all the code. I apologize for this. I am now aware of ways to use .RProj files to avoid this, but I was not when I wrote this code. 
(3) In addition to needing all packages that the scripts load, to output the same figures that I output you'll need to make sure Ghostscript is installed on your computer, and that 'gsdir' in 'dirs.R' points to the directory containing the Ghostscript executable. For detailed instructions on how to install Ghostscript, see this blogpost: http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2012/09/how-to-use-your-favorite-fonts-in-r-charts.html

Below I describe briefly describe what each file does, and which files must be run in order to generate the Figures and Tables in the main document. I don't explain which files must be run to generate all Tables and Figures in the supplementary Appendix, but if you run all scripts (or if you run '00_runall.R', which will run all scripts automatically), you'll create all the Tables and Figures that you'll find in the main paper or in the Appendix.
