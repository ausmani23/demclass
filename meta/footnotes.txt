###fig_dcapests
This graph plots the estimated long-run impact of disruptive capacity on each of three standard measures of non-elite capacity or mobilization. These estimates are standardized (i.e., divided by the average within-country standard deviation of the dependent variable and multiplied by the average within-country standard deviation of disruptive capacity). As expected, each of the three estimates is positive and statistically noteworthy at conventional levels (in the case of the union membership ratio, at $\alpha=0.10$ in a two-sided test).
###fig_prefests
This graph illustrates the statistical significance of all variables in my preferred specification, in samples of varying remove. The two panels correspond to the two different measures of democracy that I examine in this paper. The y-axis denotes the independent variable in question. The x-axis denotes the interval (in years) between observations. The purpose of this exercise is to see whether results survive at long-remove (e.g., whether disruptive capacity at time $t-10$ predicts the Polity2 score at time $t$). If so, this is better (though not at all dispositive) evidence that the main associations I discuss are causal. Disruptive capacity is positively associated with subsequent levels of democracy at all except a twenty-year remove. The statistical significance of this result fluctuates slightly when Electoral Democracy is the dependent variable, but only in the twenty-year sample does it drop below $\alpha=0.10$. Landlord power is a consistent predictor of subsequent democratization at short and long remove. Tables \ref{tab_lrp2yrs} and \ref{tab_lrvpyrs} in the Appendix report the estimates from which this figure is derived. See Section \ref{results} of the main text for further discussion of these and the other estimates.
###fig_brazilgains
This graph illustrates the estimated democratic gains in a counterfactual Brazil disruptive capacity and landlord power follow developed world trajectories. The results affirm that the estimates from the main models are practically and not just statistically significant: a meaningful change in the key independent variables implies large democratic gains. Had Brazil escaped the democracy-disabling consequences of late development, it would have experienced 46 additional years of democracy. See Sections \ref{results} and \ref{app_cfactuals} for more details.
###fig_devgains
This graph illustrates the estimated democratic gains in a counterfactual world in which all developing countries escaped the disabling features of their late development (i.e., in which disruptive capacity and landlord power all followed developed world trajectories). It generalizes the results plotted in Figure \ref{fig_brazilgains} beyond Brazil (and beyond the Polity2 Index). These gains can be compared to the actual trajectory of the advanced world over this period. As discussed in Section \ref{results}, roughly 50-60\% of the gap between the developing and advanced world is closed under this counterfactual.
###fig_sample
This graph plots the countries and years that are in the sample for my `social forces' model (Column 3 of Tables \ref{tab_lrp2} and \ref{tab_lrvp}), and in my preferred sample (Column 6). The data are concentrated in the second half of the 20th century. Only in advanced countries and in some Latin American countries are there substantial data available earlier. Moreover, since V-Dem starts in 1900, it is only in the Polity2 models that my sample spans the late 19th century.
###fig_robests
This graph reports the statistical significance of the estimated impact of disruptive capacity and landlord power, across a wide array of robustness checks on the annual sample. I have grouped these by type. The main takeaway is that my results are robust to a variety of alternative specifications. Where they are no longer statistically significant (e.g., the estimated impact of disruptive capacity in the 'Pooled' specification), there is good reason to favor my preferred model. For a full discussion of these results, see Section \ref{app_robustness} in the Appendix.
###fig_interactions
This graph reports results from a variety of interactions. The titles of each panel denote the independent variable and dependent variable under consideration. Each tile illustrates the statistical significance and sign of the effect of that independent variable, conditional on the interacted variable (y-axis) taking a different value from its distribution (along the x-axis). Note that each y-axis-panel combination plots results from a unique model, which is the preferred specification plus the interaction term in question. Section \ref{results} discusses these briefly, and Section \ref{app_robustness} gives more details.
###fig_montecarlo
This figure illustrates results from the Monte Carlo simulations I discuss in Section \ref{app_robustness}. I show that models which include a lag of the dependent variable outperform models which do not (i.e. which only account for autocorrelation by adjustment of the assumed error structure). I follow \textcite{Keele2006}, but focus on the relevant subset of the full parameter space.
###fig_jktile
This graph reports the robustness of each of my two key estimates when one country is omitted from the sample. It suggests the main results are not unduly influenced by outlying countries. The estimated impact of disruptive capacity fluctuates slightly, but is always statistically significant at $\alpha=0.05$ or less.
###fig_binmodests
This figure reports coefficients for the two main variables of interest from logistic regressions fit to democratic transitions and authoritarian rollback separately. These refer to the estimated impact of a positive change in the independent variable (on the y-axis) on the probability of the outcome (given in the column heading), across two separate specifications (on the x-axis). The models suggest that landlord power matters as anticipated: negatively associated with transition, and positively associated with rollback. Disruptive capacity matters, though the estimated effect is weakly significant in the transition models, and either absent or quadratic (positive at low levels, negative at higher levels) in the models of authoritarian rollback. See Section \ref{app_robustness} for details of these models and further discussion of these results. 
###fig_binmodpreds
This graph plots the predicted, ten-year probability of democratic transition or authoritarian rollback, based on the binary models of transition and consolidation discussed in Section \ref{app_robustness}. (The probability that the outcome in question occurs in ten years is estimated as the complement of the probability that its complement occurs every year). The x-axis ranges from low to high values of landlord power, and the y-axis ranges from low to high values of disruptive capacity.
###fig_mfit
This figure illustrates that my preferred model fits these data better than sparser models. If we take a model that has only year- and country- fixed-effects in it, more complicated models reduce error, however this error is measured.  As I discuss in Section \ref{app_robustness}, to obtain these results, I compare simulated trajectories of democratization to observed patterns. These are preferable to conventional measures of fit.
###fig_balur
This graph illustrates results from three kinds of unit root tests, run on a constructed and balanced panel of countries observed over years. Section \ref{app_robustness} discusses the construction of this balanced panel in more detail. As the graph shows, my best evidence suggests that the key series I examine in this paper are stationary, and thus justify estimating my main specification in its original levels. 
###tab_labor
This table shows that my measure of non-elite capacity has two advantages. First, it is available in a far larger sample of countries and over a far longer period. Second, it is available in a substantially less biased sample ($\Delta$ Avg. Polity2 denotes the difference between the sample Polity2 average, and the Polity2 average for all sovereign countries in the modern period) than are all other measures except for Potential Labor Power \parencite{Rudra2002}, the Labor Rights Index \parencite{Mosley2007} and the manufacturing share of GDP \parencite{Haggard2016}, all of which have inferior coverage.
###tab_descriptive
This table shows descriptive statistics from my preferred sample, where Polity2 is the dependent variable (except for the `Electoral Democracy' variable, which is from its own preferred sample). `SD' refers to the overall standard deviation, while `Within-Country SD' refers to the average of all the within-country standard deviations. Section \ref{estimation} gives more details about how these variables are measured. 
###tab_lrp2
This table reports the estimated long-run effects across the six specifications I estimate: bivariate models with my two key variables (Cols. 1 to 2), a social forces model (Col. 3), a modernization model (Col. 4), an inequality-centric model (Col. 5), and my preferred model (Col. 6), which includes all variables. The dependent variable here is the Polity2 score. As hypothesized, the long-run impact of disruptive capacity is positive and statistically significant, while the long-run impact of landlord power is negative and statistically significant. Section \ref{results} discusses these and other results in more detail. 
###tab_lrvp
This table reports the estimated long-run effects across the same six specifications shown in Table \ref{tab_lrp2}, but when the dependent variable is the V-Dem measure of electoral democracy. My main findings are the same, and other findings are similar, which shows that my results are robust to considering an alternative measure of democracy. 
###tab_srp2
This table reports the short-run estimates from which the results in Table \ref{tab_lrp2} are derived. For an explanation of how one derives long-run estimates from short-run estimates, and what long-run estimates mean, see Section \ref{app_lrm} of the Appendix. 
###tab_srvp
This table reports the short-run estimates from which the results in Table \ref{tab_lrvp} are derived.
###tab_lrp2yrs
This table reports long-run estimates when the preferred model is estimated on a dataset of varying intervals between observations, and when the dependent variable is the Polity2 score (Figure \ref{fig_prefests} shows some of this information graphically). Column 1 is the annual sample, Column 2 is the 5-year, Column 3 is the 10-year, Column 4 is the 15-year and Column 5 is the 20-year sample. In the main, my results of interest survive. Disruptive capacity is a positive and statistically significant predictor of Polity2 at all but a twenty-year remove, and landlord power is a positive and statistically significant predictor of Polity2 at all removes. Note that the sample size diminishes dramatically as the interval between observations increases. (Indeed, the twenty-year model fits the data very poorly. Results are based on within-country variation, but the average country has only a couple of observations.)
###tab_lrvpyrs
This table reports long-run estimates when the preferred model is estimated on a dataset of varying intervals between observations, and when the dependent variable is the V-Dem measure of electoral democracy (Figure \ref{fig_prefests} shows some of this information graphically). Again, the results are mostly consistent with my expectations. Disruptive capacity is a positive and statistically significant predictor of Electoral Democracy at all but a twenty-year remove (albeit at $\alpha=0.10$ in the 10-year sample). Landlord power is a negative and statistically significant predictor of Electoral Democracy in all samples.
